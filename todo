NOTE: right now we have `expressions_extra`.
      which is `Range(Index(Expression))`, while it could be removed if 
      expression return an `Expression` instead `Index(Expression)`
      but there's compiler bug with unions and wasn't able to reproduce it
      with an small example.

      NOTE: another workaround is always using ReleaseFast or ReleaseSmall
